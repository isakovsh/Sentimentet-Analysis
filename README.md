## *Introdcution*
*Sentiment analysis* is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral. Today, companies have large volumes of text data like emails, customer support chat transcripts, social media comments, and reviews.

This is an entity-level sentiment analysis [dataset of twitter](https://github.com/isakovsh/Sentimentet-Analysis/tree/master/Data). Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.
